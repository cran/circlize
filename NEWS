Change in version 0.1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* height(h) and shape(w) can be set for Bezier curve (in `circos.link`)
* add examples in man/
* add ``fromRows`` options in `chordDiagram` to control the direction of links
* Now the ``major.by`` are the same in all sectors
* define ``min.data`` and ``max.data`` in internal variable ``SECTOR.DATA``
* check that sector names cannot be empty strings ("")
* check whether circos plot has been initialized when calling `circos.trackPlotRegion`
* add ``niceFacing`` in `circos.text` to make the facing more human easy
* height of ideogram and annotation track in `circos.initializeWithIdeogram` and `circos.genomicInitialize` can be set
* some example code in examples/vignettes has been changed according to changes in the package source code
* add `posTransform.text` which can smartly put text on the circle
* ``track.margin`` and ``cell.padding`` can be set in `circos.trackPlotRegion` as a local setting

Change in version 0.0.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* links are now implemented by Bezier curve
* baseline can be set when ``type == "h"`` `in circos.lines`
* add a new function `chordDiagram` which support chord diagram
* add `facing` argument to replace `direction` in `circos.text`
* `circos.trackPlotRegion` can be used to update a track without re-setting ylim
* move demo to http://jokergoo.github.io/circlize
* re-implement `colorRamp2`

Change in version 0.0.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* axes labels will not draw when setting labels = FALSE
* add many functions supporting genomic visualization
* add a new vignette to show how to plot genomic circos plot with new functions
* add `circos.info`

Change in version 0.0.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add an example in demo codes
* improved vignettes

Change in version 0.0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* order will not change in `circos.trackPlotRegion` when not specifying `factors`, bug fixed
* add an example in 'draw relation' vignette
* add a new vignette focusing on phylogenetic tree
* support directly downloading cytoBand file from UCSC 

Change in version 0.0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* support self-define width of sectors when initializing sectors
* add simple functions to read and manuplate cytoband file
* add several new figures in the vignettes and vignettes have been improved.
* ``cell.padding`` in `circos.par` now using degree as its measurement.
* ``track.margin`` in `circos.par` now using percentage of radius as its measurement.

Change in version 0.0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* number of points to simulate quadratic curves decreased
* labels on axis in `circos.initializeWithIdeogram` is now 'vertical_right' by default
* size of the vignettes reduced
* add example of drawing heatmap and cluster dendrogram in the main vignette
* add example of drawing error area of lines by `circos.polygon`
* vignette improved
* ``gap.degree`` in `circos.par` can be a vector which means different degrees for gaps can be set
* export core function `circlize` now
* track.margin now is in correct order
* links are optimized (although not so perfect)
* no point overflow warnings when drawing axes

Change in version 0.0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* vignettes has been improved
* ``xplot`` in `get.cell.meta.data` is now corresponding to the data direction in the cell
* number of points to draw links decreased.
* `get.cell.meta.data` can provide more meta data for a cell
* start degree and end degree now consistent with the data axis.
* the first sector is drawn first now.
* add `draw.sector`

Change in version 0.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add `draw.sector` so it would be more straightforward to highlight sectors
* add ``track.margin``, ``cell.padding``, ``cell.xlim`` and ``cell.ylim`` in `get.cell.meta.data` function
* figures in vignettes are all generated automatically
* vignettes have been imporved
