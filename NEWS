- add a new function `chordDiagram` which support chord diagram
- add `facing` argument to replace `direction` in `circos.text`
- `circos.trackPlotRegion` can be used to update a track without re-setting ylim

- add `circos.info`

== 0.0.7
- add an example in demo codes
- improved vignettes

== 0.0.6
- order will not change in `circos.trackPlotRegion` when not specifying `factors`, bug fixed
- add an example in 'draw relation' vignette
- add a new vignette focusing on phylogenetic tree

== 0.0.5
- support self-define width of sectors when initializing sectors
- add simple functions to read and manuplate cytoband file
- add several new figures in the vignettes and vignettes have been improved.
- ``cell.padding`` in `circos.par` now using degree as its measurement.
- ``track.margin`` in `circos.par` now using percentage of radius as its measurement.

== 0.0.4
- number of points to simulate quadratic curves decreased
- labels on axis in `circos.initializeWithIdeogram` is now 'vertical_right' by default

- add example of drawing heatmap and cluster dendrogram in the main vignette
- add example of drawing error area of lines by `circos.polygon`
- vignette improved
- ``gap.degree`` in `circos.par` can be a vector which means different degrees for gaps can be set
- export core function `circlize` now
- track.margin now is in correct order
- links are optimized (although not so perfect)

== 0.0.3
- vignettes has been improved
- ``xplot`` in `get.cell.meta.data` is now corresponding to the data direction in the cell
- number of points to draw links decreased.
- `get.cell.meta.data` can provide more meta data for a cell
- start degree and end degree now consistent with the data axis.
- the first sector is drawn first now.
- add `draw.sector`

== 0.0.2
- add `draw.sector` so it would be more straightforward to highlight sectors
- add ``track.margin``, ``cell.padding``, ``cell.xlim`` and ``cell.ylim`` in `get.cell.meta.data` function
