\usage{
read.cytoband(cytoband = paste(system.file(package = "circlize"),
    "/extdata/cytoBand.txt", sep=""), species = NULL, sort.chr = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{cytoband}{a path of the cytoband file or a data frame that already contains cytoband data}
  \item{species}{abbrevations of species. e.g. hg19 for human, mm10 for mouse. If this value is specified, the function will download cytoBand.txt.gz from UCSC website automatically.}
  \item{sort.chr}{whether chromosome names should be sorted (first sort by numbers then by letters).}

}
\details{
  The function read the cytoband data, sort the chromosome names and calculate the length of each chromosome.  By default, it is human hg19 cytoband data.  

  You can find the data struture for the cytoband data from \url{http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/database/cytoBand.txt.gz}  


}
\value{
\describe{
  \item{df}{Original data frame for cytoband data}
  \item{chromosome}{sorted chromosome names}
  \item{chr.len}{length of chromosomes. Order are same as \code{chromosome}}
}
  There are several cirsumtances when determine the order of chromosomes. Assuming \code{chromosome} is the first clumn in the cytoband data frame, then, if \code{cytoband} is defined as a file path, or \code{species} is set, the order of chromosomes is \code{unique(chromosome)} (with or without sorted depending on \code{sort.chr}); If \code{cytoband} is set as a data frame and the first column is a factor, the order of chromosomes is \code{levels(chromosome)}; If \code{cytoband} is a data frame and the first column is just a character vector, the order of chromosomes is \code{unique(chromosome)}. Please not this concept is really important since the order of chromosomes will be used to control the order of sectors when initializing the circos plot.
