  Initialize circos plot with any genomic data  


}
\usage{
circos.genomicInitialize(data, sector.names = NULL, major.by = NULL,
    plotType = c("axis", "labels"), ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{a data frame containing genomic data.}
  \item{sector.names}{names for each sectors which will be drawn along each sector}
  \item{major.by}{increment of major ticks. It is calculated automatically if the value is not set.}
  \item{plotType}{which part should be drawn. \code{axis} for genomic axis and \code{labels} for chromosome names}
  \item{...}{pass to \code{\link{circos.initialize}}}

}
\details{
  The function will initialize circos plot from genomic data provided. If \code{plotType} is set with value in \code{axis} or \code{labels}, there will create a new track.  

  The order of sectors related to data structure of \code{data}. If it is a data frame and the first column is a factor, the order of sectors is \code{levels(data[[1]])}; If it is a data frame and the first column is just a simple vector, the order of sectors is \code{unique(data[[1]]}.  

  For more details on initializing genomic plot, please refer to the vignettes.
