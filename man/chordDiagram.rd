\usage{
chordDiagram(mat, grid.col = NULL, transparency = 0.5,
    col = NULL, row.col = NULL, column.col = NULL, directional = FALSE, fromRows = TRUE,
    symmetric = FALSE, order = NULL, preAllocateTracks = NULL,
    annotationTrack = c("name", "grid"), annotationTrackHeight = c(0.05, 0.05),
    link.border = NA, link.lwd = par("lwd"), link.lty = par("lty"), grid.border = NA,
    diffHeight = 0.04, reduce = 1e-5, link.order = -1, ...)
}
\arguments{

  \item{mat}{A table which represents as a numeric matrix.}
  \item{grid.col}{Grid colors which correspond to matrix rows/columns (or sectors). The length of the vector should be either 1 or \code{length(union(rownames(mat), colnames(mat)))}. It's preferred that \code{grid.col} is a named vector of which names correspond to sectors.  If it is not a named vector, the order of \code{grid.col} corresponds to order of sectors.}
  \item{transparency}{Transparency of link colors, 0 means no transparency and 1 means full transparency. If transparency is already set in \code{col} or \code{row.col} or \code{column.col}, this argument will be ignored.}
  \item{col}{Colors for links. It can be a matrix which corresponds to \code{mat}, or a function which generate colors  according to values in \code{mat}, or a single value which means colors for all links are the same. You may use \code{\link{colorRamp2}} to generate a function which maps values to colors.}
  \item{row.col}{Colors for links. Links from the same row in \code{mat} will have the same color. Length should be same as number of rows in \code{mat}. This argument only works when \code{col} is set to \code{NULL}.}
  \item{column.col}{Colors for links. Links from the same column in \code{mat} will have the same color. Length should be same as number of columns in \code{mat}. This argument only works when \code{col} and \code{row.col} is set to \code{NULL}.}
  \item{fromRows}{Unequal height of link root is used to represent the link direction. If links are directional, whether they start from Rows. The starting root is always more inside to circle centre than the ending root.}
  \item{directional}{Whether links have directions. The directions are always from rows to columns. If you want the direction from columns to rows, set \code{fromRow} to \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{symmetric}{Whether the matrix is symmetric. If the value is set to \code{TRUE}, only lower triangular matrix without the diagonal will be used.}
  \item{order}{Order of sectors. Default order is \code{union(rownames(mat), colnames(mat))}.}
  \item{preAllocateTracks}{Pre-allocate empty tracks before drawing chord diagram. It can be a single number indicating how many empty tracks needed to be created or a list containing settings for empty tracks. Please refer to vignette for details.}
  \item{annotationTrack}{Which annotation track should be plotted? By default, a track containing sector names and a track containing grid will be created.}
  \item{annotationTrackHeight}{Track height corresponding to values in \code{annotationTrack}.}
  \item{link.border}{border for links, single scalar or a matrix with names}
  \item{link.lwd}{width for link borders, single scalar or a matrix with names}
  \item{link.lty}{style for link borders, single scalar or a matrix with names}
  \item{grid.border}{border for grids. If it is \code{NULL}, the border color is same as grid color}
  \item{diffHeight}{The difference of height between two 'roots' if \code{directional} is set to \code{TRUE}. }
  \item{reduce}{if the ratio of the width of certain grid compared to the whole circle is less than this value, the grid is removed on the plot. Set it to value less than zero if you want to keep all tiny grid.}
  \item{link.order}{order of links in single sector. The value is a length-two vector which  controls order of sectors which correspond to rows and columns respectively.}
  \item{...}{pass to \code{\link{circos.link}}}

\details{
Chord diagram is a way to visualize numeric tables ( \url{http://circos.ca/intro/tabular_visualization/} ), especially useful when the table represent information of directional relation. This function visualize tables in a circular way.  

Sectors of the circos plot is \code{union(rownames(mat), colnames(mat))}. If there is no rowname or colname, the function will assign names for it ("R1", "R2", ... for row names, "C1", "C2", ... for column names).  

This function is flexible and contains some settings that may be a little difficult to understand.  Please refer to vignette for better explanation.
